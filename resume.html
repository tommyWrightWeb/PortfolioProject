      <br><strong> Personal statement</strong>

      <br>
      <br>

      As a recent University graduate of Computer Science, Coupled with an online web development bootcamp, I now feel i
      have adequate knowledge and experience of full stack development to seek employment. Both the degree and bootcamp
      exposed me to a wide range of web development tools and processes, including problem solving, algorithms and
      maths. I've collaborated on a number of projects, and worked on my own projects too. I have ample time working
      with HTML, CSS and Javascript, including frameworks and libraries such as  J-Query, NodeJS, Express and Bootstrap,
      with knowledge of database programming with technologies such as MongoDB, GitHub, and testing practices. My
      studies have also allowed me to build apps and websites, exposed me to OOP principles, Java, Python, UX and UI,
      cloud technologies, and i'm now ready to step up and rise to the next challenge.
